  },
  
  database_security: {
    access_control: "Least privilege database access",

    mfa: "Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations",
    session_management: "Secure cookie settings and server-side validation"
  },
  
  authorization: {
    principle: "Default deny; explicit grants required",
    data_access: "Users can only access their own data",
    admin_access: "Strict controls and MFA for administrative functions",
    api_security: "Token-based authentication with short lifetimes"
  }
}
```

## 5. Core Infrastructure Security

```blueprint
Component InfrastructureSecurity {
  network_security: {
    segmentation: "Separate public, application, and data tiers",
    waf: "Web Application Firewall for OWASP Top 10 protection",
    encryption: "TLS 1.2+ for all external traffic"
  },
  
  system_security: {
    hardening: "Minimal installation + regular patching",
    access: "No direct production access; use bastion hosts"
  },
  
  secrets_management: "Centralized, access-controlled secrets storage",
  
  monitoring: {
    logging: "Centralized logging of security events",
    alerting: "Real-time alerts for suspicious activity"
  },
  
  vulnerability_management: {
    scanning: "Regular automated scanning",
    patching: "Critical vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours"
  }
}
```

## 6. Incident Response Essentials

```blueprint
Component IncidentResponse {
  preparation: "Documented response plan and defined team roles",
  
  detection: "Security monitoring and alerting system",
  
  response: {
    containment: "Isolate affected systems",
    investigation: "Preserve evidence and determine root cause",
    eradication: "Remove threat and remediate vulnerabilities",
    recovery: "Restore from secure backups after verification"
  },
  
  communication: "Clear internal and external communication plan",
  
  post_incident: "Formal review and lessons learned"
}
```

## 7. Top Security Risks & Mitigations

```blueprint
Component CriticalRisks {
  top_risks: [
    Risk "Injection Attacks" {
      mitigation: "Input validation, parameterized queries, WAF"
    },
    
    Risk "Broken Authentication" {
      mitigation: "Strong password policies, MFA, secure session management"
    },
    
    Risk "Sensitive Data Exposure" {
      mitigation: "Encryption, data minimization, secure key management"
    },
    
    Risk "Broken Access Control" {
      mitigation: "Default deny, server-side enforcement, regular reviews"
    },
    
    Risk "Security Misconfiguration" {
      mitigation: "Hardened configurations, minimal attack surface, regular scanning"
    },
    
    Risk "Cross-Site Scripting" {
      mitigation: "Output encoding, CSP, input validation"

    }
  ]
}
```

## 8. Security Development Essentials

```blueprint
Component SecureDevelopment {

    requirements: "Include security requirements and threat modeling",
    design: "Security architecture review",
    implementation: "Secure coding practices and code reviews",
    testing: "Security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)",
    deployment: "Secure configuration validation",
    maintenance: "Vulnerability management and monitoring"
  },
  
  activities: {
    threat_modeling: "STRIDE methodology at design phase",
    code_review: "Security-focused code reviews for critical components",
    security_testing: "Both automated and manual security testing"
  },
  
  security_gates: "No deployment with critical or high vulnerabilities"
}
```

## 9. Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers, never relying on a single control

2. **Secure Defaults**: Systems should be secure out of the box without additional configuration

3. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum access required for functionality

4. **Complete Mediation**: Validate every access attempt against authorization rules

5. **Fail Secure**: System failures should default to secure state

6. **Economy of Mechanism**: Simpler designs have fewer security flaws

7. **Open Design**: Security should not depend on secrecy of design

8. **Psychological Acceptability**: Security measures must be usable and not overly burdensome

9. **Weakest Link**: Security is only as strong as the weakest component

10. **Continuous Improvement**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation
