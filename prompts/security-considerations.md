1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls ensure that a failure in one area doesn't compromise the entire system.

2. **Data Security Focus**: Protecting user data should be a priority through encryption, access controls, and data minimization practices.

3. **Authentication & Authorization**: Strong identity management and access controls are fundamental to application security.

4. **External Service Protection**: Secure integration with third-party services requires careful API security and response validation.

5. **Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents promptly.

6. **Regular Security Testing**: Continuous security validation through automated testing and periodic manual assessment ensures security controls remain effective.

7. **Secure Development Practices**: Security integrated throughout the development lifecycle prevents introducing vulnerabilities in new code.

8. **Privacy by Design**: Building privacy controls from the beginning ensures compliance with regulations and protects user data.

9. **Incident Preparedness**: A well-defined incident response process ensures quick and effective handling of security events.

10. **Third-Party Security**: Careful assessment and monitoring of external dependencies and services prevents supply chain attacks.

11. **Content Safety**: Both user inputs and service outputs need filtering to maintain appropriate content and prevent injection attacks.

12. **Continuous Improvement**: Security is an ongoing process requiring regular reassessment and enhancement as threats evolve.
